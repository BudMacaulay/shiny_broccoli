# shiny_broccoli

With my deteriorating state of mind, i have decided to make the crappy scripts a bad coder (me) has writen over the coming few months into actual readable work.

Now I know what you're thinking, he's insane why would he make HIS work public. Now settle down folks. While i am quite possibly the most talented man to ever grace this great earth, if i don't get to show off my incredulous skill and make you all feel feeble what good is my existance.

Thanks

Until next time, keep that energy
